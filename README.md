        *) pulo.py:
            Don't know a better name for this ... General Utility module
            
        *) opera.py:
            This should be for the web, but may be it isn't <=>
            Common operations on the Web and Filesystem
            
        *) adapters.py:
            Different Adapter patterns. Adapt Types/Interfaces and 
            Objects/Instances.
            
        *) workers.py:
            This is my take on the whole Multi-threading Multi-processing thing.
            It should be a light-weight, and simple to use module.
